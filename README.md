Problem Statement:

1) Using 1) Weights & biases 2) TensorBoard  ML development toolkits for image classification and OCR
2) Compare Tensorflow’s custom deep learning based classifier with Scikit learn’s MLP classifier.
3) Analyze, compare and test the performance of these two models on CIFAR10 and MNIST dataset.

MNIST Dataset has been evaluated using Keras, and visualised using Tensorboard

CIFAR-10 Dataset has been evaluated using Keras based model, and visualised using TensorBoard

Evaluation:

1) Understandability of the tools: Both the tools have a very descriptive documentation provided. 
2) Ease of implementation: We found Weights and Biases more easier and intuitive. Furthermore, everything can be viewed separately on your profile unlike Tensorboard.
3) Accuracy and Results on the dataset: Accuracy achieved on CIFAR and MNIST is comparable to the state-of-art performance. 
4) UI creative dashboards: Weights & Biases is more suited for comparing different experiments and performances whereas Tensorboard is better suited for visualization of a particular experiment.
5) Performance Visualization: Both the tools have a functionality to visualize the popular performance metrics like, ROC curve, confusion matrix and precision/recall, etc.
